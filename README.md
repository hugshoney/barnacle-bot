## Behind the Source Code
I always want to learn English but I'm so unmotivated, and I want to learn programming too, but I'm so lazy. Because of that, I'm trying to learn programming while making a Telegram bot to help myself learn English. Now, my English and programming skill that I have still sucks :sweat_smile:.

## Quick Start Setup
1. Donwload latest program in here. *not ready right know*
2. Run terminal program and open directory where you put `barnaclebot`.
3. Create `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` variable in your shell. e.g. `export TELEGRAM_TOKEN=1235335:BlahbLaHblAh`
4. Run program with `./barnaclebot`.

## List Bot Command
- `/mean <word>`: Get definition of the word.
- `/slang <word>`: Get slang definition of the word.
- `/synonym <word>`: Get synonyms of the word.
- `/quote`: Get random quotes.
- `/random`: Get random word.
