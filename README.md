## Behind the Source Code
I always want to learn English but I'm so unmotivated, and I want to learn Python programming too, but I'm so lazy. Because of that, I'm trying to learn Python programming while making a Telegram bot to help myself learn English. Now, my English and programming skill that I have still sucks :sweat_smile:. 

## List Bot Command

- `/slang <word>`: Get slang definition of the word.
- `/synonym <word>`: Get synonyms of the word.
- `/quote`: Get random quotes.
